Dear readers.

We provided some original data sources and code to ensure the reproducibility of the study. These data include = three parts: 10 uav images, 10 courtyard images, and reproducible codes. They are in the corresponding folders.

It is important to note that we strictly follow data ethics when obtaining data. We promised the farmers in the village not to harm their privacy, and only part of the data was made public. Farmers can accept the disclosure of this data. And our research is based on all data. So the data and methods disclosed are designed to show that the research can be reproduced. 

All conclusions of the research are still subject to the article.

SincerelyÔºÅ
